# Security Enhancements for 500-Bros Social Network

This document outlines the security enhancements implemented in the social network application.

## 1. Rate Limiting

Rate limiting has been implemented to protect against brute force attacks and DoS attempts:

- **General Rate Limiter**: Applied to all routes, limits to 60 requests per minute
- **Auth Rate Limiter**: Applied to authentication endpoints, limits to 5 requests per minute with 5-minute blocking
- **Sensitive Rate Limiter**: Applied to sensitive operations, limits to 10 requests per minute

The rate limiting middleware is implemented with a custom in-memory store solution that:

- Tracks requests by IP address
- Supports configurable points (request limits)
- Supports configurable time windows
- Supports blocking periods for exceeded limits

## 2. HTTP Security Headers

Enhanced security headers using Helmet middleware:

- **Content Security Policy (CSP)**: Restricts sources of content loading
- **Strict Transport Security (HSTS)**: Enforces HTTPS connections
- **X-Frame-Options**: Prevents clickjacking attacks
- **X-Content-Type-Options**: Prevents MIME-type sniffing
- **X-XSS-Protection**: Helps prevent cross-site scripting attacks
- **Referrer Policy**: Controls information sent in the Referer header
- **DNS Prefetch Control**: Controls DNS prefetching

## 3. Input Validation

Implemented comprehensive input validation using Zod schema validation:

- **Request Body Validation**: Validates and sanitizes request bodies
- **Query Parameter Validation**: Validates and sanitizes URL query parameters
- **URL Parameter Validation**: Validates and sanitizes URL path parameters

Validation middleware is applied to critical endpoints:

- User registration
- User authentication
- Password reset flow

## 4. Security Audit Logging

Implemented security audit logging for sensitive operations:

- Logs security-relevant actions with detailed context
- Captures IP addresses, user IDs, and request details
- Special handling for sensitive endpoints
- Redacts sensitive information (passwords, tokens)
- Different log levels based on request sensitivity

## 5. CORS Configuration

Enhanced CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) policy:

- Restricted origins based on environment configuration
- Limited allowed HTTP methods
- Limited allowed headers
- Added credentials support for authenticated requests
- Configured cache duration

## 6. XSS Protection

Implemented XSS (Cross-Site Scripting) protection:

- HTML sanitization for user-provided content
- Script tag removal from request bodies
- CSP headers to restrict script execution

## 7. Request Sanitization

Added middleware to sanitize incoming requests:

- HTTP Parameter Pollution protection
- Input sanitization to prevent injection attacks

## Recommendations for Further Security Enhancements

1. **HTTPS Implementation**: Configure the application to use HTTPS in production
2. **Database Query Parameterization**: Ensure all database queries use parameterization to prevent SQL injection
3. **Regular Security Audits**: Implement a schedule for security code reviews
4. **Security Dependency Scanning**: Regularly scan dependencies for vulnerabilities
5. **User Session Management**: Implement proper session invalidation and rotation
6. **Password Policies**: Enforce stronger password requirements
7. **Two-Factor Authentication**: Add 2FA for enhanced account security
